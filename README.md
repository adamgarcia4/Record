# Record - Helping identify discriminatory practices in the workplace

## Motivation
I was selected amongst 90 applicants to participate in the [3rd Annual Code for the Mission](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/help-ucla-chancellor-gene-block-develop-an-app) challenge.  My teammates were [Will Gu](https://github.com/willgu29) and [Tanuj Lalwani](https://github.com/tanujlalwani).  During this competition, I was very fortunate to work directly alongside the Chancellor of UCLA, Gene Block.  Together, and through many iterations, a product was designed to help address inequality in the workforce and in academia.

This software allows companies to record meetings and provide unbiased statistics to help identify discriminatory practices.

## Demonstration
